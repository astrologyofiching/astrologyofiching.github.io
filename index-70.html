		<description><![CDATA[I Ching Horoscope can give us a knowledge about how we should develop ourselves to be more auspicious...]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hexagram illustrates stages of development of an individual. Line of hexagram describes qualities which man should possess to achieve the level of auspiciousness illustrated by hexagram line. Text for <strong>Least Auspicious</strong> can provide an information about what mistakes a person could make that could prevent him to have higher level of auspiciousness. Text for <strong>Most Auspicious</strong> can provide an information about qualities which person should possess to be more auspicious. Reading a hexagram a person can understand which qualities he/she should develop in him- or herself to achieve most auspicious line in a hexagram.</p>
<p>For example let&#8217;s take a look at the commentary for the <strong>first</strong> line of the hexagram 44 &#8220;Kou. Contact (Relationships)&#8221;:</p>
<div id="attachment_826" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 191px"><img class="size-full wp-image-826" title="44. Kou. Contact (Relationships)" src="http://astrologyofiching.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/kou_441.jpg" alt="44. Kou. Contact (Relationships)" width="181" height="124" /><p class="wp-caption-text">44. Kou. Contact (Relationships)</p></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Most auspicious:</strong> He will try to do what is right but will have insufficient talent and strength to accomplish anything truly great. However, he will provide for himself and his family adequately.</p>
<p><strong>Least auspicious:</strong> He will possess very little talent or experience, and limited abilities. He will tend to act rashly or recklessly in his efforts to succeed, but this will only produce more difficulties.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we can see, a person who have the first line of hexagram 44 as the control line of his birthday hexagram should beware to act &#8216;rashly or recklessly in his efforts to succeed&#8217;. On the other hand such person should develop his strength and talent to be more auspicious and maybe he will achieve more auspicious line of the hexagram, for example, <strong>fifth</strong> line:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Most auspicious:</strong> He will be very wise and open-minded. He will love people and be able to treat all, the good and the bad alike, impartially. He will be an exceptional speaker and writer, by the means of which, with his learning and innate intelligence, he will gain fame and fortune.</p></blockquote>
<p>I beleive that to achieve the level of auspiciousness described by the fifth line the one should develop qualities mentioned in the quote above.</p>
<p>So, I Ching Horoscope can give us a knowledge about how we should develop ourselves to be more auspicious and what qualities can impede our inner-development.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[He will be a pillar of the nation...]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To while away the time I decided to take a closer look to I Ching Horoscope for Barack Obama and&#8230; I found a coincidence which I consider as <strong>amazing</strong>.</p>
<p>Currently Obama is 49 years old, thus, he is in his Later Heaven period of life. Here is his Later Heaven hexagram:</p>
<p><strong>28. Ta Kuo. Inner Preponderance.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-809" title="Later Heaven Hexagram for Barack Obama" src="http://astrologyofiching.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Later_Heaven_Hex_For_Barack_Obama.jpg" alt="Later Heaven Hexagram for Barack Obama" width="229" height="129" /></p>
<p>Fourth (red) line of the hexagram is a control line. Here is a quote of the commentary to this line:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Most auspicious:</strong> He will be greatly talented, wise, valiant, far-sighted and energetic. <strong>He will be a pillar of the nation</strong>, accomplishing many things of great merit, and will be <strong>respected both nationally and internationally</strong>. He will have a good life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Barack Obama is the President of the United States, so I beleive, he can be considered as &#8216;pillar of the nation&#8217;. Bingo!</p>
<p>In the aphorism for this line I Ching Horoscope also gives a warning:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ridgepole is arched. Good fortune. <strong>If independence is not exercised, humiliation.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe this warning could relate to current political issues in US. How do you think?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When reading your I Ching Horoscope, you can often find phrases like &#8216;it&#8217;s beneficial to meet a great man&#8217;. What does it mean? I Ching was written for rulers, so, in ancient times if a ruler was in need of a new knowledge, he had meetings with scholars or wise persons. &#8216;To meet a great man&#8217; means to meet some wise and honest person, who can give you useful advice about your life, about work, about relationships, business and so on. &#8220;Great man&#8221; is a knowledgeable person, a person who you respect. It can be someone of your relatives, it can be experienced business consultant, scientist. Giving such advise, I Ching points out that it is very useful not to hesitate to ask for advice from the wise person when you need it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Black is a symbol of mourning and bereavement in Western societies, but in Chinese culture Black, corresponding to water, is a neutral color]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is an example of difference between Eastern and Western culture:</p>
<ul>
<li>White is the color of mourning in Chinese culture. Unlike the Western meanings of purity, chastity, holiness and cleanliness, white is associated with death and is used predominantly in funerals in Chinese culture. Ancient Chinese people wore white clothes and hats only when they mourned for the dead.</li>
<li>Black is a symbol of mourning and bereavement in Western societies, but in Chinese culture Black, corresponding to water, is a neutral color. The I Ching, regards black as Heaven’s color. The saying “heaven and earth of mysterious black” was rooted in the observation that the northern sky was black for a long time. They believed Tian Di, or Heavenly Emperor, resided in the North Star.</li>
<li>The Taiji symbol uses black and white to represent the unity of Yin and Yang. Ancient Chinese regarded black as the king of colors and honored black longer than any other color. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_Zi">Lao Zi</a> said that <em>five colors make people blind,</em> so the Dao School chose black as the color of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dao">Dao</a>.</li>
<li>In modern China, black is used in daily clothing. Possibly adopted from Western practices, black may also be used during a funeral to symbolize mourning. A black ribbon is usually hung over the deceased&#8217;s picture.</li>
</ul>

Thus, many advises given in I Ching are reflecting how you should behave and be inwardly to establish proper relationships with people.

<p>As a matter of fact, I Ching and I Ching Astrology was created for Kings (superior persons), that is, managers. Thus, many advises given in I Ching are reflecting how you should behave and be inwardly to establish proper relationships with people. It is interesting that there are many of such people-oriented advises, attached to lines of Daily Hexagrams.</p>
<p>Here are few examples of such comments to a Daliy Hexagram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Do not indulge in pretence or in airs. Superior persons may proceed, if they are careful.<br />
<em>Daily Hexagram 14. Ta Yu. Great Possessing. (line 3)</em></p>
<p>You may be trying to use too much strength for your position.<br />
<em>Daily Hexagram 34. Ta Chuang. The Power of the Great. (line 3)</em></p>
<p>Try to be well balanced. Do not try to influence others by words alone. Support words with strength.<br />
<em>Daily Hexagram 43. Kuai. Resoluteness. (line 3)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you are working with people I Ching astrology may be especially useful for you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In I Ching Horoscope created by <a href="http://astrologyofiching.com/four-pillars-of-wisdom-i-ching-software/buy-product-subscription/" target="_self">Four Pillars of Wisdom</a> there is an omen which is called <strong>Primeval Fortune</strong>. It can be found on the Horoscope Summary page in the Omens section.</p>
<div id="attachment_727" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 393px"><img class="size-full wp-image-727 " title="Barak Obamas Primeval Fortune in Four Pillars of Wisdom" src="http://astrologyofiching.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/primeval_fortune_barak_obama.jpg" alt="Barak Obamas Primeval Fortune" width="383" height="165" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Barak Obama Primeval Fortune in Four Pillars of Wisdom</p></div>
<p>Primeval Fortune is kind of answer to the question &#8216;Were you born at the right time?&#8217; Using I Ching Astrology, for every moment of time favorable &#8216;primeval&#8217; trigram (half of a hexagram consisting of 3 lines) can be calculated. Simply speaking, if your Birthday Hexagram (Pre- or Later Heaven) contains favorable trigrams then your Primeval Fortune is favorable. It means that your Birthday Hexagram(s) are in harmony with trigram(s) related to the moment of time when you were born.</p>
<p>If you have favorable or very favorable Primeval Fortune in your I Ching Horoscope then you were born at the right place at the right time according to I Ching Astrology.</p>
<p>It is interesting that many VIPs whose profiles are included in Four Pillars of Wisdom, have favorable or very favorable Primeval Fortune. For example, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman has very favorable Primeval Fortune. Barak Obama, Vladimir Putin and Brad Pitt has favorable Primeval Fortune.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://astrologyofiching.com/four-pillars-of-wisdom-i-ching-software/buy-product-subscription/">were you born lucky</a> according to your Primeval Fortune? <img src='http://astrologyofiching.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

		<description><![CDATA[Basic character traits of a person are forming approximately until the age of 10 years...]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
<li>Extreme change of environment;</li>
<li>Extreme events in life of an individual;</li>
<li>Strong desire to fulfill a purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basic character traits of a person are forming approximately until the age of 10 years. After the age of 10 years the character of a person can be strongly changed only because of reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>How many times did you hear something like &#8216;this is the last time I drink alcohol, eat too much etc.&#8217; but didn&#8217;t see any changes in behaviour after that? I think, no changes occur just because there&#8217;s no big reason to make them.</p>
<p>The first and the second reason of inward change is occuring rarely. People who are living usual life, not often can find themselves in some extreme situation which affects whole life. Revolution doesn&#8217;t happen every day.</p>
<p>The third reason is the most interesting. A goal can change a person who strive for it because fulfilling a purpose require a set of abilities. If a person don&#8217;t have them, the one should change himself in order to achieve the result.</p>
